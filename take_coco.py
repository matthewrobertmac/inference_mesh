TensorFlow Lite supports a wide range of hardware accelerators, enabling efficient execution of models, and offers APIs for various programming languages, facilitating integration into different application ecosystems. With TensorFlow Lite, developers can bring the power of machine learning to edge devices, enabling them to perform tasks such as image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing directly on the device, without relying on a cloud server.")

It also employs a novel inverted residual block that enhances information flow and allows for better feature representation.
